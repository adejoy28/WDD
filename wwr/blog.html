            <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
            <img src="images/blog-rafting.jpg" alt="">
            <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the
                Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to
                one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our
                family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests
                braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures
                soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any
                trouble getting people in the wate1r at those temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
            <img src="images/blog-rafting.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these
                areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you
                should find yourself face to face with one.</p>

            <p>There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There
                are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions
                can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The
                scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most
                venomous in the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to
                their prey and luckily humans are not on that list!</p>

            <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths,
                spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be
                found with ice, aspirin and time.</p>

            <p>When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes
                or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a
                scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.</p>

            <p>Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one
                of two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate
                brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that
                helps them detect and avoid predators.</p>

            <p>Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short
                with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.</p>

            <p>If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100
                feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.
